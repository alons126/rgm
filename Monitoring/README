./monitorPID  will output the inputs required and the order 

Reading many files within a directory
=============
/path/to/files/file_0.hipo
/path/to/files/file_1.hipo
/path/to/files/file_2.hipo
....
/path/to/files/file_N.hipo

You can read these files by passing the string /path/to/files/file_\*.hipo as the input file. The TChain inside will read all the events with that placeholder. The \ is needed in front of the * to pass the character along to main.
